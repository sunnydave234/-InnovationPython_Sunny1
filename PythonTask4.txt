#1. Write a program to reverse a string.
a = "Sunny"
print(a[::-1])	


#2. Write a function that accepts a string and prints the number of uppercase letters and lowercase
letters.
a = input("enter a string: ")
u=0
l=0
for i in a:
    if i.isupper():
        u+=1
    if i.islower():
        l+=1
    else:
        pass
print("No. of Uppercase characters: ", u)
print("No. of Lower characters: ", l)


#3. Create a function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list.
def unique(l):
    a=[]
    for i in l:
        if i not in a:
            a.append(i)
    return a

#4. Write a program that accepts a hyphen-separated sequence of words as input and prints the words
in a hyphen-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.

s=input("enter string: ")
sl=s.split("-")
sl.sort()
print('-'.join(sl))


#5. Write a program that accepts a sequence of lines as input and prints the lines after making all
characters in the sentence capitalized.
a = input("enter string: ")
print(a.upper())


#6. Define a function that can receive two integral numbers in string form and compute their sum and
print it in the console.
def s(a, b):
    c = int(a)+int(b)
    return c

#7. Define a function that can accept two strings as input and print the string with the maximum length
in the console. If two strings have the same length, then the function should print both the strings line
by line.
def maxlen(a,b):
    if len(a)>len(b):
        print(a)
    elif len(a)==len(b):
        print(a)
        print(b)
    else:
        print(b)

#8. Define a function which can generate and print a tuple where the values are square of numbers
between 1 and 20 (both 1 and 20 included).
def sq():
    l = []
    for i in range(1,21):
        l.append(i*i)
    print(tuple(l))


#9. Write a function called showNumbers that takes a parameter called limit. It should print all the
numbers between 0 and limit with a label to identify the even and odd numbers.
def showNumbers(limit):
    for i in range(0, limit+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            print(i,"EVEN")
        else:
            print(i, "ODD")

#10. Write a program which uses filter() to make a list whose elements are even numbers between 1
and 20 (both included)
L=list(range(1, 21))
a=list(filter(lambda n: n%2==0, L))
print(a)

#11. Write a program which uses map() and filter() to make a list whose elements are squares of even
numbers in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].
L= [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
a= list(map(lambda i: i**2, (list(filter(lambda n: n%2==0, L)))))
print(a)

#12. Write a function to compute 5/0 and use try/except to catch the exceptions
a=5
b=0

try:
    c=a/b
    print(c)
except Exception:
    print("Can not divide by zero.")


#13. Flatten the list [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] into 1234567 using reduce().
from functools import reduce
L= [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
a=reduce(lambda a,b:10*a+b, L, 0)

#14. Write a program in Python to find the values which are not divisible by 3 but are a multiple of 7.
Make sure to use only higher order functions.

L= list(range(1,100))
a=list(filter(lambda n: n%7==0 and not n%3==0, L))
print(a)

#15. Write a program in Python to multiply the elements of a list by itself using a traditional function
and pass the function to map() to complete the operation.
l=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
def mul(n):
    return n*n
r=list(map(mul, l))
print(r)

#16. What is the output of the following codes:
(i) 2
(ii) NameError: name 'f' is not defined
     after f
     after f?
