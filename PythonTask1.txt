#TASK ONE NUMBERS AND VARIABLES

#1.Create three variables in a single line and assign values to them in such a manner that each one of them belongs to a different data type.
E.g. :
a = 1,
b = 2.01,
c = 'string'
Ans: 
a, b, c = 11, 3.11, 'Sunny'

#2.Create a variable of type complex and swap it with another variable of type integer.
Ans:
a, b, c = 11, 3.11, 'Sunny'
d = 3+6j

a,d = d,a
print(a,d)

#3.Swap two numbers using a third variable and do the same task without using any third variable.
Ans:
#Swap two numbers using a third variable 
e=4
f=5
temp=0
temp=e
e=f
f=temp
print(e,f)

#without using third variable
e,f = f,e
print(e,f)


#4.Write a program that takes input from the user and prints it using both Python 2.x and Python 3.x Version.
Ans: 
g=input("enter value: ")
print(g)
print g


#5.Write a program to complete the task given below: 
Ask users to enter any 2 numbers in between 1-10 , add the two numbers and keep the sum in another variable called z. Add 30 to z and store the output in variable result and print result as the final output.
Ans:
number1 = int(input("enter first number from 1-10: "))
number2 = int(input("enter second number from 1-10: "))
z=number1+number2
result=z+30
print(result)

#6.Write a program to check the data type of the entered values.
HINT: Printed output should say - The data type of the input value is : int/float/string/etc
Ans: 
value = eval(input("enter value: "))
print(type(value))

#7.Create Variables using formats such as Upper CamelCase, Lower CamelCase, SnakeCase and  UPPERCASE.
Ans:
name = "John"
Age = 25
birth_date = "April, 29th"

#8.If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’ again. Will it change the value? If Yes then Why?
Ans: 
Yes, it’ll change the value. If you have assigned a value a = 1 and then you assigned the value of a to 2 and print a then it’ll print 2 instead of 1 because python only remembers values assigned later and that’s how python works.
