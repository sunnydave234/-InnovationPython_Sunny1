#1. Create a list of 10 elements of four different data types like int, string, complex and float.
List1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, "Sunny", "John", 3+6j, 4.6, 5.4, 1.1]

#2. Create a list of size 5 and execute the slicing structure
List=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
a= List[0:3]
print(a)

#3. Write a program to get the sum and multiply of all the items in a given list.
from functools import reduce
List=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
addition = reduce(lambda a,b:a+b, List)
print(addition)
multiplication = reduce(lambda a,b:a*b, List)
print(multiplication)

#4. Find the largest and smallest number from a given list.
List=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
maximum = max(List)
minimum = min(List)
print("Max: ", maximum)
print("Min: ", minimum)

#5. Create a new list which contains the specified numbers after removing the even numbers from a
predefined list.
List = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
List_even = []

for i in List:
    if not i % 2 == 0:
        List_even.append(i)
print(List_even)


#6. Create a list of elements such that it contains the squares of the first and last 5 elements between
1 and30 (both included).

l=list(range(1,31))
L=[]
for i in l:
    L.append(i*i)
print(L[:5]+L[-5:])

#7. Write a program to replace the last element in a list with another list.
l1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
l2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

l = l1[0:(len(l1)-1)] + l2

print(l)


#8. Create a new dictionary by concatenating the following two dictionaries:
a = {1 : 10, 2 : 20}
b = {3 : 30, 4 : 40}
c = {**a,**b}
print(c)


#9. Create a dictionary that contain numbers in the form(x:x*x) where x takes all the values between 1
and n(both 1 and n included).
a=int(input("Enter the number of values you need in the dictionary: "))
d = {}

for i in range(1,a+1):
    d[i]= i**2
print(d)

#10. Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and
generates a list and a tuple which contains every number in the form of string.

a = input("enter numbers separated by ',': ")
l = a.split(",")
t = tuple(l)
print(l, t)
